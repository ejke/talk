What is it? How to recognise you have one?

How to do it
2. talk when you have opinion
5. make a way to ask questions in the way that you show that you know something but not everything

10. communicate those issues  - finding out your peers have also self-doupt and they are not superhuman know-it-all robots helps a lot. EX: honest retros
11. Don't lie in your skills - it will come out. even halflie is no good (knowing the thing half-way)
12. tim ferriss self-evaluation: hungry? tired? yep, then skip the thought for later. not proper to deal with them.
13. take action - do, learn, talk, run. it helps timiding the feeling.
14. stop giving excuses for successes. own it and fake it til you make it where you want to be.
15. positive self talk. acknowledge the inner critic telling you off. shut it.
16. don;t let ego come on the way of asking questions.
17. take note of archievements

ex: couldn't speak to coworkers cause eyes were watering of thoughts that I'm not good enough and I don't know how to do it.
